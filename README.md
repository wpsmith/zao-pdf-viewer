# Zao PDF Viewer

PDF Viewer shortcode plugin. Uses [Mozilla's pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) for displaying a beautiful native-feeling PDF viewer.

The `pdfviewer` shortcode supports either an `id` attribute for displaying a viewer for a pdf in the media library, or `url` for displaying any pdf URL (as long as it is on the same domain), and a `height` attribute for determining the height of the viewer iframe. The plugin has an options page to define the default fallback height.
